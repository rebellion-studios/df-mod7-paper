## How Autopsy Is Used
### By Matthew Campbell

Hello aspiring ethical hackers, my name is Matthew Campbell and today we will be looking at a very powerful tool specifically designed for digital forensics: Autopsy. Autopsy is free to download from its official website, https://www.autopsy.com/.

Autopsy was first released in 2000 [2]. At the time of this writing, the program is at version 4.21.0 [3], released August 29th, 2023. Autopsy is a powerful open-source digital forensics platform that analyzes hard drives, phones, and other storage devices. It’s widely used by investigators, law enforcement agencies, and cybersecurity professionals to examine and extract digital evidence from various sources [1]. There are several key features that make this one of the best analysis tools on the market.

Autopsy supports 3rd party add-ons. These are available from the official GitHub page [3]. The program is open source, meaning the source code is free to everybody. Users are free to find bugs that can then be submitted and fixed for the next release [1]. The program doesn’t rely on any one platform to operate [1]. It can run smoothly on Windows, Linux, and Mac. As well as across different operating systems, including legacy systems like Windows 95. (Although Mac users may find installing the program to be rather difficult.) Users will find quite a friendly interface. The interface is easy to read and quick to understand for both novice and experienced investigators [1]. Autopsy supports both automated and manual analysis [1]. This allows investigators to either automate the modules or manually examine and analyze the digital evidence. The program allows the use of keyword searches through file names as well as their contents [1]. Autopsy can recover deleted files and provide information about file attributes and metadata [1]. You are able to extract and analyze emails, web history, chat logs, and images (to name a few) [1]. Autopsy also facilitates timeline analysis. This visually “represents events and activities over specific time periods for a comprehensive understanding of investigations [1]”. Autopsy supports one of the most useful things ever conceived: hashing. It can match hashes, allowing investigators “to identify known files or files with known signatures, aiding in the identification of malicious content [1]”. Autopsy also “enables users to generate detailed reports of their findings, providing comprehensive documentation for legal purposes or collaboration with other investigators [1]”.

Autopsy can easily be compared to other digital forensics tools. While Autopsy has a variety of features (prefetch files, event logs, showing using activity), one of the biggest features missing is password recovery. For that, one must go to another forensics program, OSForensics [5]. Autopsy currently does not support RAID reconstruction, nor OSForensics, but X-Ways does [5]. This software is also, as stated above, one of the few that is open source. Autopsy only supports the Chrome, Internet Explorer/Edge, and Firefox browsers, while OSForensics also supports Safari and Opera (but who even uses Opera?) [5]. While Autopsy is good at search queries, it is not good at caches [5]. You’ll need to use FTK or EnCase for that. Autopsy has good database support, being able to recover deleted records, while OSForensics is unable [5].

There are multiple pros and cons when using this software. 3 of the pros, stated at the beginning, are being open source, its cross-platform compatibilities, and 3rd party add-ons. But one of the biggest pros would have to be its extensive file system support. This software supports a very wide range of file systems, including NTFS, FAT, APFS, and so much more [4]. As with any good program, there are bound to be bad things. Depending on the size and complexity of a case, Autopsy can sometimes require significant processing power and storage space [4]. There is also a major learning curve for those who are not familiar with forensics concepts. There is also very little mobile support [4]. One of the biggest cons is the update schedule. While Autopsy is actively maintained by a dedicated community, “the pace of updates and support may vary, and users may encounter issues or delays in receiving assistance for specific problems [4].” Just looking at the release schedule on GitHub is problematic. The newest version was released in August of 2023, before that was in January. The were no updates at all throughout 2022. Updates followed in March, 2 in August, November, and December of 2021. 2020 saw 4 releases in January, May, September, and November. Those are just from the last 4 years.

There are many companies that use Autopsy [6]. One company founded in 2018 and located in Pensacola, Florida, Argo Cyber Systems, provides 24-7 cyber security monitoring services. They help big and small companies fight cyber attacks. Argo also has services including on-site consulting services, penetration testing, and short and long term staff augmentation [7]. They advertise that they can “carefully analyze your entire digital environment, using behavioral analysis and a hypothesis-driven approach to find unusual behavior that may indicate the presence of malicious activity [7]”.
